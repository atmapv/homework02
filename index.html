          <p> I have always wondered how people managed to create such vast worlds inside a TV/computer screen; how they
            were able to make something out of nothing; how they were able to tell a computer what to do. All of these
            video games made me want to follow the footsteps of the game developers.

            <p>I, too, wanted to create something that would have a lasting impact on people; something that would
              trigger nostalgia; something that would serve as a temporary relief for people going through tough
              times; something that is worthwhile; something that makes people happy; that would make me happy.
            </p>

            <p>Combined with my passion for learning and Mathematics, the stage was set for me to begin my programming
              journey.</p>

            <p>In order to make sure that I understood the basics of programming, I started with web development to keep
              things simple. I could say that I did not regret that decision at all. Perhaps I could even say that it
              was the best decision I could have made at the time. In many ways, JavaScript helped me understand what
              programming truly is and how it works (which I can say right now is more than just typing fast and
              memorizing syntax). Now that I'm learning Full Stack Development to start my journey in becoming a
              developer, all of my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, MySql, Database and API is making the
              learning process easier, faster, and more intuitive.</p>

            <p>It is important to know why we code in the first place to prevent the dreaded burnout. Forgetting our
              roots will surely get us lost in the monotony of programming. With that said, who or what was your
              inspiration to do programming? For sure, mine were video games and the passion for learning,
              Mathematics, and creating things that work, function, and serve purpose to others.</p>
